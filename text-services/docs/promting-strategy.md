# Comparing Prompting Methods for LLMs

## Introduction
This document analyzes two prompting strategies for Large Language Models (LLMs) and recommends an approach for implementation in our text processing service.

## Method 1: Direct Instruction Prompting
This method follows the principles outlined in "ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers" and focuses on:

### Principle 1: Writing clear and specific instructions

- **Tactic 1**: Using delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
- **Tactic 2**: Asking for structured output
- **Tactic 3**: Asking the model to check whether conditions are satisfied
- **Tactic 4**: "Few-shot" prompting (providing examples)

### Principle 2: Giving the model time to "think"

- **Tactic 1**: Specifying steps required to complete a task
- **Tactic 2**: Instructing the model to work out its own solution before concluding

**Advantages:**

- Clear and direct instructions lead to more predictable outputs
- Structured outputs make parsing results easier
- Works well for straightforward tasks with defined expectations

**Disadvantages:**

- May not achieve optimal results for complex reasoning tasks
- Doesn't explicitly encourage the model to show its reasoning process

## Method 2: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting
This method focuses on encouraging the model to break down complex problems into intermediate steps.

**Key features:**

- Explicitly asks the model to reason step-by-step
- Shows the "working out" process before arriving at conclusions
- Can be combined with few-shot examples showing the reasoning process

**Advantages:**

- Improves performance on complex reasoning tasks
- Provides transparency into how conclusions are reached
- Reduces reasoning errors by forcing systematic thinking

**Disadvantages:**

- Can be verbose and produce longer outputs
- May be unnecessary for simpler tasks
- Requires careful prompt design to guide effective reasoning



## Implementation Testing Results
After implementing an enhanced Chain-of-Thought approach with explicit reasoning steps, testing revealed significant issues:

- Performance for summarization and categorization tasks declined
- Output format consistency suffered when models attempted to document reasoning
- The verbose nature of explicit CoT created inefficiencies in processing
- The additional structure complicated rather than enhanced simpler tasks

These practical findings necessitated a refinement of our theoretical approach.

## Recommendation: Hybrid Guided Thinking Approach

After implementation testing, I recommend a more balanced hybrid approach that guides model thinking without requiring explicit documentation of reasoning steps.

**Reasoning:**

1. Our text processing tasks (summarization, categorization, keyword extraction) benefit from deeper analysis, but explicit step documentation creates output consistency issues
2. Testing showed that full Chain-of-Thought implementation was "not good for the Summarize and Categorize tasks"
3. A hybrid approach that encourages careful thinking without requiring its documentation provides better practical results
4. For these specific NLP tasks, output format consistency is as important as reasoning quality

## Why Guided Thinking Over Full Chain-of-Thought

Initial testing revealed several practical challenges with a full CoT implementation:

1. **Output Format Interference**: Requiring explicit reasoning steps made it difficult for models to maintain the strict output formats needed for automated processing
2. **Excessive Verbosity**: Full CoT produced unnecessarily verbose responses for relatively straightforward tasks
3. **Task Complexity Mismatch**: While CoT excels for complex reasoning, it creates overhead for more direct text analysis tasks
4. **Implementation Inefficiency**: Documenting each step consumed unnecessary tokens and processing time

## Implementation Strategy

1. Include thinking guidance in prompts without requiring its documentation in responses
2. Keep output format instructions prominent to ensure consistent, parseable results
3. Maintain focus on the final output quality rather than the reasoning process
4. Encourage implicit reasoning through prompt language that suggests what to consider
5. Adjust guidance depth based on task complexity (more for analysis, less for categorization)

This refined approach offers the benefits of thoughtful analysis while avoiding the practical drawbacks of explicit reasoning documentation.


## Prompting 

### Summarize

```bash
SUMMARIZE_PROMPT = (
    "Create a concise summary of the following news article in EXACTLY 3 sentences. "
    "Focus on the main points, key facts, and central message. "
    "Think step-by-step before writing your summary: identify the main topic, key information, and most important conclusions. "
    "Ensure your final summary is clear, informative, and captures the essence of the article.\n\n"
    "Article: {text}\n\n"
    "3-Sentence Summary:"
)
```

### Categorize

```bash
CATEGORIZE_PROMPT = (
    "Analyze the following news article and categorize it into EXACTLY ONE of these categories: "
    "Technology, Sports, Health, Politics, Finance, Business.\n\n"
    "Before deciding, consider: the primary subject matter, key entities discussed, main events or concepts, "
    "and which category best represents the overall focus of the article.\n\n"
    "Choose the single most appropriate category that best represents the primary focus of the article. "
    "Return only the category name without additional explanation or commentary.\n\n"
    "Article: {text}\n\n"
    "Category:"
)

```

### Extract Keywords

```bash
EXTRACT_KEYWORDS_PROMPT = (
    "Extract 5-10 relevant keywords or key phrases from the following news article. "
    "Focus on terms that best represent the main topics, entities, and themes of the content. "
    "To identify the most effective keywords: consider the central topic, recurring terminology, "
    "important entities (people, organizations, locations), and technical terms specific to the subject matter.\n\n"
    "Format requirements:\n"
    "- Return ONLY the keywords themselves\n"
    "- Each keyword should be separated by a comma (,)\n"
    "- Do NOT use bullet points, asterisks, or markdown formatting\n"
    "- Do NOT number the keywords\n"
    "- Do NOT add explanations or descriptions\n\n"
    "Article: {text}\n\n"
    "Keywords:"
)
```

### Fully Processing

```bash
PROCESS_PROMPT = (
    "Perform a comprehensive analysis of the following news article to extract structured information.\n\n"
    
    "Analyze the article carefully to:\n"
    "1. Summarize the main content in EXACTLY 3 sentences, focusing on the key information and central message.\n"
    "2. Categorize the article into EXACTLY ONE category from: Technology, Sports, Health, Politics, Finance, Business.\n"
    "3. Extract 5-10 relevant keywords that best represent the distinctive content and themes.\n\n"
    
    "Before responding, think about the article's primary subject, key entities, important events, core message, and distinctive terminology.\n\n"
    
    "Article: {text}\n\n"
    
    "Provide your analysis as JSON with these fields: 'summary', 'category', and 'keywords'.\n\n"
    
    "Expected output format:\n"
    "```json\n"
    "{\n"
    "  \"summary\": \"First sentence of summary. Second sentence of summary. Third sentence of summary.\",\n"
    "  \"category\": \"SelectedCategory\",\n"
    "  \"keywords\": \"keyword1, keyword2, keyword3, keyword4, keyword5\"\n"
    "}\n"
    "```"
)
```
